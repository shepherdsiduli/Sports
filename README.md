Android Assessment

What are we looking for in the solution (don’t stress if you feel you didn’t get all the below points
right- we have an interview where we can just talk about the stuff you didn’t have time to
address):
● Clean code
● Kotlin and JAVA knowledge, Kotlin is prefered
● Approach to architecture in a small app
● Object-oriented programming
● SOLID
● Language knowledge and experience
● Basic memory management
● Unit tests
● Testing practices
● QA practices
● REST APIs usage practices
● Handling Activity lifecycle
● We would like to follow your work and see how you work with git-flow. We would also like
to do a code review, add our comments and discuss it in the interview. Please provide
public access to the repo.

Worth mentioning:
● You can choose any libraries you like, the only requirement is that you’d use this
library/framework in production.
● The designs are up to you, feel free to change them. Apply the common design patterns
popular on your platform. Please make sure the app is usable
● Assume that there would be some other functionalities added to the app in the future
● Ideally, we should be able to checkout and compile the project out of box both on mac or
windows. These machines will be setup with the relevant default IDEs.
